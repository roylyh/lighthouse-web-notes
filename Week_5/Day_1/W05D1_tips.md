## Clause order
(keywords order in postgres)

The main clauses of a SELECT statement in PostgreSQL are written in the following order:

**SELECT
FROM
JOIN
WHERE
GROUP BY
HAVING
WINDOW
ORDER BY
OFFSET
LIMIT**

## Postgres
**startpostgres** start postgres server  
**psql**
There are 3 commands you need to know once PostgreSQL is installed:

**sudo service postgresql status** for checking the status of your database.
**sudo service postgresql start** to start running your database.  
**sudo service postgresql stop** to stop running your database.

\c connect to a database  
\l list available databases  
\dt list available tables  
\d table_name describe a table  
\df list available functions  
\du list users and their roles  
\i filename execute psql commands from a file  
\\? get help  
\time turn on query execution time  
\q quit psql

## SQL
JOIN  
PostgreSQL supports inner join, left join, right join, full outer join, cross join, natural join, and a special kind of join called self-join. (self-join with alias)

## Explain
Known as a Query Plan or Execution Plan, EXPLAIN shows us information such as which tables are scanned, and which indexes are used for JOINs.

## Self Join
In this activity we will practice JOINing a table to itself.(SQLZoo)

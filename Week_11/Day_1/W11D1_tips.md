# Roy's Note -- Web Design Vocabulary List

## Introduction
Does it feel like there's an endless amount of website terminology to learn and keep up with?

## Homepage
A homepage is essentially the cover to your website.

## Header
The header typically looks the same from page to page and contains an organization's logo and navigation, creating a central hub to get elsewhere on the website.

## Mega Menu
Like a dropdown menu, a mega menu appears when a user rolls over a primary navigation item. But instead of a simple list of child pages, visitors can see a map of all the child and grandchild pages in the section.

## Search Bar
A search bar is typically located in the upper right-hand corner of the website’s header. 

## Link
Links allow website users to get from one web page to the next. They can be in the form of text or an image.

## Hover State
A hover state (also called a rollover state) is the slight animation that is triggered when a user rolls their cursor over a link.

## Dropdown Menu
Dropdown menus reveal themselves when a user rolls over a primary navigation item, as a list of child pages (so named since they stem from the parent pages). 

## Primary Navigation
Primary navigation is typically a list of prominent links toward the top of the page, with titles that help users determine where they want to go from wherever they are on the site.

## Secondary Navigation
Secondary navigation is typically found in the website header above the primary navigation.  Log In, Donate, or Volunteer

## Breadcrumb
A breadcrumb is essentially a trail at the top of any given web page that shows a user where that particular page lives within the site structure. the breadcrumb at the top might say Home / About / Mission and Vision

## Selected State
A selected state is usually found in a list of navigation links to show what link is selected at that moment. For example if a site visitor is on the About Us page, the “About Us” link in the header would have some sort of selected state activated. The text may be bold, underlined, a different color or all of the above.

## Sidebar
A sidebar can be a very diverse piece of a website and typically appears on the majority of a site’s internal pages. A sidebar is used to house important pieces of information that an organization doesn’t want to get lost within the body.

## Call to Action(CTA)
A Call to Action is exactly what it sounds like; a visual element asking users to complete an action.

## Footer
A footer is the caboose of any given site. Similar to the header, the footer stays the same page to page, but it appears at the very bottom of every single page of the website rather than the top.

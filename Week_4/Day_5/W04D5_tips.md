## Algorithms
An algorithm is a set of instructions or steps for accomplishing a specific task. This pretty much means that the steps you take to accomplish something are an algorithm.   
In computer science, an algorithm is a set of steps that a computer takes to accomplish a task.

## Key words
**Algorithmic complexity**  
**running time:** We can count up all of the elementary operations that an algorithm performs and call that its running time. So if a an algorithm performs n elementary operations, we say the running time is n.

worst case scenario

Big O Notation  
As we increase the amount of data, does the algorithm grow linearly, exponentially, or logarithmically?  
2n + 3 will grow linearly, O(n) Linear O(n)   
100n^2 will grow exponentially, O(n^2) Quadratic O(n^2)  
log n + 1000000000 will grow logarithmically, O(log n) Logarithmic O(log n)   
Constant O(1) constant time

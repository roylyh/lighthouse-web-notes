# Template Engine
EJS [How To Use EJS to Template Your Node Application](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-ejs-to-template-your-node-application)  
*Create a new file called _header.ejs inside the new partials directory.Notice that the name of this file starts with an underscore (_). This is to signify that it's a partial, in this case, a header partial.*  
The syntax for includes has changed in the latest version of EJS. Use:
```
<%- include('partials/_header') %>
```

## CRUD
Almost all web applications allow users to manipulate data in various ways, which we typically break down into four categories: *Create, Read, Update and Delete*.
| Action      | Description | HTTP Method | 
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Create      | Add a new record       | GET |
| Read        | Retrieve the value of a record        | POST |
| Update      | Update a record's value        | PUT |
| Delete      | 	Delete a record        | DELETE |

## Middleware
Express is a routing and middleware web framework that has minimal functionality of its own: An Express application is essentially a series of middleware function calls.

Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. The next middleware function is commonly denoted by a variable named next.

Here are some useful middleware in Express:
```javascript
// Create a new morgan logger middleware function using the given format and options. 
const morgan = require('morgan');
app.use(morgan('dev'));

// read cookie from header of reques
const cookieParser = require('cookie-parser');
const username = req.cookies.username;
res.clearCookie("username");

// This module stores the session data on the client within a cookie, while a module like express-session stores only a session identifier on the client within a cookie and stores the session data on the server, typically in a database.
const cookieSession = require('cookie-session');
app.use(cookieSession({
  name: 'cookiemonster',
  keys: ['key1', 'key2'],
}));
// clear the cookie on res or set req.session = null
req.seesion = null;
res.clearCookie("cookiemonster").clearCookie("cookiemonster.sig")

// access public folder
app.use(express.static('public'));

// Create a new middleware function to override the req.method property with a new value. 
const methodOverride = require('method-override');
// override with POST having ?_method=DELETE
app.use(methodOverride('_method'))

// A library to help you hash passwords.
const bcrypt = require('bcryptjs');
const hash = bcrypt.hashSync('bacon', 8); // 8 is salt
bcrypt.compareSync(password in DB, hash); // true

// This is a built-in middleware function in Express. It parses incoming requests with urlencoded payloads and is based on body-parser.
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: false }));

app.set('view engine', 'ejs');
app.render("xxx", { key: value})
```


## tips
curl -i <url> show the response with header  
[curl documentation](https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html)
The order of route definitions matters! The GET /urls/new route needs to be defined before the GET /urls/:id route. Routes defined earlier will take precedence, so if we place this route after the /urls/:id definition, any calls to /urls/new will be handled by app.get("/urls/:id", ...) because Express will think that new is a route parameter. **A good rule of thumb to follow is that routes should be ordered from most specific to least specific.**


```javascript
// generate Ramdom String
const generateRandomString = function(length = 6) {
  return Math.random().toString(20).substring(2,length + 2);
};
```

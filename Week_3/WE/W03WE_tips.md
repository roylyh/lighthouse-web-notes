## DOM
At the most basic level, a website consists of an HTML document. The browser that you use to view the website is a program that interprets HTML and CSS and renders the style, content, and structure into the page that you see.  

The browser creates a representation of the document known as the Document Object Model. This model allows JavaScript to access the text content and elements of the website document as objects.

## Event Propagation
**Bubbling**  
When an event happens on an element, it first runs the handlers on it, then on its parent, then all the way up on other ancestors.

**Capturing**

# CI/CD

CI: Continuous integration is the practice of integrating all code changes into the main branch of a shared source code repository early and often, automatically testing each change when you commit or merge them, and automatically kicking off a build.  
CD: Continuous delivery is a software development practice that works in conjunction with CI to automate the infrastructure provisioning and application release process.
